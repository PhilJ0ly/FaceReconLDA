Facial Recognition using Linear Discriminant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and Singular Value Decomposition.

##ABSTRACT

Whether it is on the latest smart phone or passing through airport security, we interact with facial
recognition everyday. This feat of computer vision may seem magical; however, it relies heavily on
fundamental concepts of mathematics. This paper explores various linear algebra concepts such as
singular value decomposition and linear discriminant analysis and their application in fast and efficient
facial recognition. Starting with a collection of 64 168x192 images of 38 different subjects from the
Extended Yale Face Database B, a software capable of differentiating each individual was designed by
applying mathematical approximation, reduction, clustering, and classification techniques. We were able
to compress and decompress images from 32 256 down to 800 values retaining the predominant facial
features, using a truncated version of the left singular matrix. Furthermore, using linear discriminant
analysis, looking at the 300 leading left singular vectors, we were able to associate new images back to
each subject in the database.
